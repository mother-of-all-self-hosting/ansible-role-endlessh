# Endlessh Ansible Role

[endlessh-go](https://github.com/shizunge/endlessh-go) is a Golang implementation of endlessh, an SSH tarpit.

- with everything run in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers
- powered by the [endlessh-go container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/shizunge/endlessh-go)

## Installing

To configure and install endlessh on your own server(s), you should use a playbook like [Mother of all self-hosting](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) or write your own.

Refer to the documentation for this role on the MASH side, [here](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/services/endlessh.md).
